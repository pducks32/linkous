# Linkous

This is just a simple gem to convert urls in text into anchor tags. Seriously that's it. Sorry for being so simple. ðŸ˜“

## Background

I needed to allow a client to write emails with some templating language-like features, which started off with having clickable linksâ€“hence the nameâ€“and would certainly grow as the client's needs expanded. RIght now, it's similar to how Apple devices auto make links and stuff clickable though hopefully [Apple doesn't sue me](http://bgr.com/2014/04/01/apple-vs-samsung-lawsuit-patents-2014/) for less than 10 lines of code. ðŸ˜¬

I made it its own gem because like [Michel Martens](http://soveran.com), I like small, useful libraries so putting this functionality in my app felt wrongâ€“plus who doesn't love how easy RubyGems and Bundler make it to share code!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'linkous'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install linkous

## Usage

```ruby
require "linkous"

Linkous.convert_links "Just go to http://example.com" # => "Just go to <a href='http://example.com'>Just go to http://example.com</a>"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
